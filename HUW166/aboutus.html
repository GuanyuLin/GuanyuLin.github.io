        <h2>We love good tea</h2>
        <p>Refreshing, invigorating, robust or soothing, our love for tea infuses everything we do: from blending at our own factory in Sri Lanka, all the way to your freshly brewed cup. But tea is much more than that. We care about everyone in our supply chain. From pickers, to packers, to blenders, to drinkers. Small farming, Organic, Fairtrade and Sustainable are words close to our heart. Not just for the impact they have on our own business, but for generations to come. Do you like it fruity or fresh? Something to pep you up or chill you out? Naturally, we have the classics (our English Breakfast Tea is up there with the best of them) but sometimes everyone needs a Chocolate Super Berry Burst to liven things up. Our tea comes from Sri Lanka to you with love. Tea. Loving. Care.</p>

        <h2>We know how important tea is</h2>
        <p>And we know how important it is to go right to the source.  Since 2010 we’ve sourced the best tea from the best farms in the world. Then our team of experts combines them at our own factory to create just the right balance of yummy flavours. After that our tea is hand packed, reducing our carbon footprint. From there it’s a hop, skip and jump over the sea and across the globe - into your cup.</p>

        <h2>We care deeply about the way our tea is grown and harvested</h2>
        <p>‘Sustainable’ isn't just a buzz word to us – it drives everything we do. We're proud of our certifications from the Soil Association and Fairtrade International, not to mention the Control Union Certifications and the various other quality management systems. But we go even further. Our teas and ingredients come from small farmers in limited quantities, grown without chemical fertilisers or pesticides. We are committed to recognize and to tell the world how these small farmers make a huge impact on sustaining the planet’s natural eco system for many generations after us. We pay them a premium on top of the Fairtrade price to make sure they can farm in the most sustainable way possible. Not only that, we take measures to uplift the wellbeing of the farmers and their families. That way, we'll be able to enjoy their delicious tea for generations to come. And that's good for everyone.</p>

        <h2>We're lucky to work with some of the loveliest and most dedicated people</h2>
        <p>As a company, we’re committed to improving the lives of our staff. We call it; “Love Care Change”. At our factory in Sri Lanka we have in-house training programmes to elevate the lives of our employees. The subjects vary from English, Information Technology to various Personality and Attitude training and practically important subjects such as tea tasting, farming etc. We also support the local community. We are committed to help the community at large at times of emergency. In addition, we love it when our customers write to tell us about their tea experience. Even if it's bad. Really. It's the only way we can keep improving our teas. As our packaging says: “We value your feedback to help us serve you better.” Reach out to us, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
